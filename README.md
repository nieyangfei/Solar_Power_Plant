# Solar_Power_Plant
At a 260 MW solar power plant, under the supervision of my professor and field technicians, I maintained and repaired over 1,000 circuit boards in a single-axis solar tracker system, ensuring the safe and continuous operation of control systems. To improve maintenance efficiency, I developed Modbus-RTU and Zigbee communication software to enable data exchange with the monitoring and control generation system.

At another distributed power site, I calibrated and configured Zigbee wireless communication modules, improving the reliability of remote monitoring.
